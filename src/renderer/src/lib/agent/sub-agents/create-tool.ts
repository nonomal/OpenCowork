  return `Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Task tool launches specialized agents (sub-agents) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has its own focused system prompt and inherits the complete tool set exposed to the parent agent for the current run.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
${agentLines}
- custom: General-purpose sub-agent with a built-in default system prompt and the same tools as the parent agent. Use this when none of the specialized agents above are a clean fit. You only supply the task via "prompt" - tool access is inherited automatically. (Tools: same as parent agent)

When using the Task tool, you MUST specify a "subagent_type" parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the Task tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly.
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead.
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead.
- For tasks that are not related to any of the agent descriptions above and cannot be expressed as a focused prompt, do the work yourself.

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do.
- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance. To do that, send a single assistant message containing multiple Task tool_use blocks.
- When the sub-agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result is not visible to the user - you must send a concise text summary back to the user after the agent returns.
- Each sub-agent invocation is stateless: it does not see the current conversation history, so write self-contained prompts that include all context the sub-agent needs.
- Sub-agents inherit the parent's current tools, including Task when it is available, so they may delegate further when useful.
- Clearly tell the sub-agent whether you expect it to write code or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches), since it does not see the user's intent.
- The sub-agent's outputs should generally be trusted.
- If a sub-agent's description says it should be used proactively for its domain, prefer launching it without waiting for the user to ask.
- If the user explicitly asks for work to run "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool_use blocks.
- Set "run_in_background": true to spawn a teammate that runs independently. Your turn ends after spawning - you will be notified automatically when the teammate finishes. Background mode requires an active team (TeamCreate).

Example usage:

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: (writes the function using the Edit tool)
<commentary>
A significant code change was just made, so delegate verification to a focused sub-agent.
</commentary>
assistant: (launches a Task with subagent_type="custom", description="verify prime function", prompt="Verify that isPrime() in <file> is correct, run any available tests, and report pass/fail with evidence.")
</example>

<example>
user: "investigate why the main agent runtime hangs on startup"
<commentary>
Open-ended investigation across many files - exactly what Task is for.
</commentary>
assistant: (launches a Task with subagent_type="custom", description="investigate runtime startup hang", prompt="Investigate why the main-process agent runtime hangs on startup. Trace the initialization path, identify the blocking await, and report the root cause with file:line evidence.")
</example>`
